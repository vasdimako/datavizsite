                    The visualization presented on this page is based on the GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP)<a href="./sources.html#nasa" class="ref">(1)</a>, which is an estimate of global temperature change.
                    Even as climate change threatens to become irreversible, there is increasing skepticism in the validity of the concept, the extent of the danger or both. 
                    In a 2021 <a href="https://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us/">survey on climate change beliefs</a> , 19% of participants
                    responded that global warming would harm future generations 'Little or not at all'. <a href="./sources.html#survey"class="ref">(2)</a>
                    A well-informed public would apply pressure to regulatory bodies and governments to take measures against climate change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of this, it is important to create visualization methods that effectively communicate how rapidly climate change is affecting the planet, as well as its dangers. The 'climate spiral' 
                    <a href="./sources.html#spiral" class="ref">(3)</a> presented above
                    achieves this by showing the global fluctuations in temperature each month since 1880. An absolute change of one degree may not seem significant to the viewer, but a few degrees may be
                    devastating to the planet. This visualization effectively communicates the significance of a one degree fluctuation in three ways:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The relatively stable global temperatures of the years 1880-1980 feature prominently in the animation for a long time and in cool colours (whites and blues).</li>
                    <li>As the fluctuations increase, the colour gradient used shifts to red, usually associated with high temperatures. In the last few seconds of the animation, the temperature
                        fluctuations increase so that they are consistently close to 1 degree, represented by a bright red colour.
                    </li>
                    <li>At the end of the animation, the visualization shifts to a different dimension, showing the actual spiral. This drives home the point that fluctuations have increased dramatically
                        in the last few years. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The climate spiral visualization does not demonstrate the effect of climate change on the planet, but it is an effective representation of how rapidly climate change is affecting global temperature.
                    Crucially, it shows that a one degree change, which one might consider small, is significantly outside the normal temperature fluctuations in the preceding hundred years.
